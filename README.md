### Machine Learning
Here are some steps about how to use our machine learning code :
1. Find your own dataset (you may find it manual or find another resources that served open source dataset) in this case you can just download the dataset from the github that we already served and move it into your own google drive.
2. Run the ipynb file (Denteeth.ipynb) via google colab and change the file directory drive to the file that you downloaded
3. Run the entire google colab
4. Download the tflite file from the session storage in google drive.
5. Deploy the model to android studio
#### NB : you can change the model, layer, and optimizer however you want.

### CLOUD COMPUTING
Designing architecture for cloud system and build the environment to store the resource and provide server to do the process in google cloud service. Then create a database with MySQL for organizes, integrates, and control the output from the process in server and create Rest Api with Express framework and ORM Sequelize to simplifyingÂ communication between database and android to serve the data output .
