### Machine Learning
Here are some steps about how to use our machine learning code :
1. Find your own dataset (you may find it manual or find another resources that served open source dataset) in this case you can just download the dataset from the github that we already served and move it into your own google drive.
2. Run the ipynb file (Denteeth.ipynb) via google colab and change the file directory drive to the file that you downloaded
3. Run the entire google colab
4. Download the tflite file from the session storage in google drive.
5. Deploy the model to android studio
#### NB : you can change the model, layer, and optimizer however you want.

### CLOUD COMPUTING
Designing architecture for cloud system and build the environment to store the resource and provide server to do the process in google cloud service. Then create a database with MySQL for organizes, integrates, and control the output from the process in server and create Rest Api with Express framework and ORM Sequelize to simplifyingÂ communication between database and android to serve the data output .
Here are the steps how to deploy API use Cloud Run :
1.Create compute engine and install mysql 
2.Use public eksternal IP address on VM instance, for url host database
3.Enter SSH on VM instance and import database local
4.if connected, can deploy with cloud run
5.Cloud storage and cloud build automatically created 
6.Cloud run server is ready

### Mobile Development (Android)
Here are the steps on how to use mobile development (Android) code:
1. Clone project into your computer
2. Open your Android studio, then find the location of the cloned android folder on your computer
3. Open the android folder, if there is a gradle update and other components, wait until the process is complete.
4. Run the android program using an android emulator or using an android device directly.
